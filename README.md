# Chat Practice Project

Welcome to my **Chat Practice Repository**! 
This repository is all about learning and practicing Git, GitHub workflows, and building interactive web applications. It's a hands-on project where I dive into coding, experimenting, and mastering the basics of version control while having fun creating a functional chat application.
